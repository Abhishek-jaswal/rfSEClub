# rfSE Club - Round Table for Students & Engineers üåè

## What We Are

rfSE Club (Round Table for Students & Engineers) is an innovative education initiative by MountainKid Innovations Private Limited based in Jakhu Hill, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh.

## Who We Are

MountainKid Innovations Private Limited / MountainKid AI, led by Aariv, is a Shimla-based tech company dedicated to solving Food, Health, Tourism, and Agriculture problems using AI, Rust, and Blockchain technologies. And we want to do all these things in our dream place -- MountainKid Valley.

## Our Dream

Build India‚Äôs next tech valley (MountainKid Valley) by 2030 in Himachal, making it one of the top 5 economies in the country. And to do that, we need real engineers but since the conventional education system isn't pacing up with the advancement around the world, we are building rfSE Club to empower students with first-principles thinking,mathematics,problem analysis and programming equipping them to innovate/invent to solve problems. At the moment, we are working actively in preparing the curriculum with quick iterations. Simultaneously we are connecting schools, colleges and individual free minded souls to Engineers at MountainKid bypassing the traditional education system. And hopefully by the end of this year, we will be releasing a virtual school software for everyone to improve the user experience.

## What's next?

our ultimate goal is to scale this model across Himachal Schools initially and expand it further across the country and the world by integrating MountainKid custom in-house language models along AR/VR-based learning, to create a sustainable, tech-driven education system that inspires the next generation of innovators.
