# Exploring Numbers

## Natural Numbers

Natural numbers are the basic counting numbers starting from 1 and going on infinitely. They're used to count objects and are among the first numbers we learn.

**Key Features:**

* Always positive.
* Do not include fractions or decimals.
* Useful for everyday counting.

**Examples:**

* First 10 natural numbers: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
* Natural numbers from 11 to 19: `11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19`

**Real-World Uses:**

* Counting steps, books, or students in a classroom.

## Whole Numbers

Whole numbers include all natural numbers, plus the number 0.

**Whole Numbers Include:** `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...`

**Important Note:** 0 is the smallest whole number.

**Real-World Uses:**

* Showing no goals in a game.
* Representing an empty container.

---

## Integers

Integers include all whole numbers and their negative counterparts. Zero is also considered an integer, though it is neither positive nor negative.

**Set of Integers:** `..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`

**Examples:**

* Positive: `1, 2, 3`
* Negative: `-1, -2, -3`

**Real-World Uses:**

* Temperature: `-5°C` indicates cold weather.
* Bank account: `-₹100` represents debt.

## Fractions

Fractions represent parts of a whole and are written like `a/b`, where visual examples like a pie chart or a chocolate bar cut into equal parts can help illustrate the concept more clearly. where `a` is the number of parts you have and `b` is the total parts.

**Examples:**

* `1/2`: Half
* `3/8`: Three out of eight equal parts

**Types of Fractions:**

* **Proper**: Numerator < Denominator (e.g., `3/4`)
* **Improper**: Numerator ≥ Denominator (e.g., `5/4`)
* **Mixed**: A whole number and a fraction (e.g., `1 1/4`)

**Common Uses:**

* Pizza slices
* Ingredient measurements

## Decimals

Decimals are numbers that use a decimal point to separate whole and fractional parts. They are closely related to fractions—for example, 0.75 is the decimal equivalent of 3/4. To convert a decimal to a fraction, identify the place value (tenths, hundredths, etc.) and write the decimal accordingly; for example, 0.5 becomes 1/2 and 0.2 becomes 1/5 after simplification.

**Examples:**

* `0.5` (half)
* `1.25` (one and one-quarter)
* `2.75` (two and three-quarters)

**Conversions:**

* `3/4 = 0.75`
* `2/5 = 0.4`

**Real-World Uses:**

* Price tags
* Fuel levels
* Distances in meters or kilometers

## Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers can’t be written as exact fractions. They are important in real-life calculations, especially in construction, engineering, and navigation, where precise measurements like diagonals and circular distances are involved. Their decimal forms never end or repeat.

**Examples:**

* `√2 ≈ 1.4142...`
* `π ≈ 3.141592...`

**Where We See Them:**

* Geometry formulas
* Natural patterns like spirals

## Comparing Numbers

Comparing helps us determine which numbers are larger, smaller, or equal. For example, when comparing a decimal and a fraction, you can convert both to the same form: 0.75 and 3/4 represent the same value, so they are equal.

**Symbols:**

* `>` means greater than
* `<` means less than
* `=` means equal to

**Examples:**

* `7 > 4`
* `-2 < 0`
* `1.5 > 1.25`

**Real-World Uses:**

* Game scores
* Comparing heights or weights
