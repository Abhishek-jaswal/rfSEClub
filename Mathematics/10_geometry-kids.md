# Geometry Kids

Geometry is the branch of math that deals with shapes, sizes, and how things fit together in space. It helps us understand the world around us—from buildings and roads to planets and art.

## 1. What is a Shape?

A **shape** is the form of an object. It can be flat (2D) or solid (3D).

### Examples of 2D Shapes

* **Square**: 4 equal sides and 4 right angles
* **Rectangle**: 2 long sides and 2 short sides, all angles are 90°
* **Triangle**: 3 sides
* **Circle**: round, no corners

### Examples of 3D Shapes

* **Cube**: like a dice, has 6 square faces
* **Cylinder**: like a can
* **Sphere**: like a ball
* **Cone**: like an ice-cream cone

## 2. Points, Lines, and Angles

* A **point** is a tiny dot that shows a place.
* A **line** is straight and goes forever in both directions.
* A **line segment** is part of a line with two ends.
* An **angle** is made where two lines meet.

### Types of Angles

* **Right angle** = 90°
* **Acute angle** < 90°
* **Obtuse angle** > 90° and < 180°

```txt
 Right Angle:   L
 Acute Angle:   <
 Obtuse Angle:  ⟜
```

## 3. Perimeter and Area (2D)

* **Perimeter**: the total length around a shape.
* **Area**: how much space a shape covers.

### Examples

* **Square**: Side = 4 cm

  * Perimeter = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 cm
  * Area = side × side = 4 × 4 = 16 cm²

* **Rectangle**: Length = 5 cm, Width = 3 cm

  * Perimeter = 2 × (5 + 3) = 16 cm
  * Area = 5 × 3 = 15 cm²

* **Triangle** (base = 6 cm, height = 4 cm)

  * Area = (1/2) × base × height = 12 cm²

* **Circle**: Radius = 3 cm

  * Circumference = 2 × π × r ≈ 18.84 cm
  * Area = π × r² ≈ 28.26 cm²

## 4. Surface Area and Volume (3D)

* **Surface Area**: total area of all faces of a 3D object
* **Volume**: how much space it takes inside

### Examples

* **Cube**: side = 3 cm

  * Surface Area = 6 × side² = 6 × 9 = 54 cm²
  * Volume = side³ = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 cm³

* **Cylinder**: radius = 2 cm, height = 5 cm

  * Volume = π × r² × h ≈ 3.14 × 4 × 5 = 62.8 cm³

## 5. Real-Life Uses of Geometry

* Designing buildings and bridges
* Creating art and logos
* Engineering and architecture
* Navigation and maps
* Understanding nature (honeycombs, shells, leaves)
