# Expressions and Variables

In algebra, expressions and variables are essential tools for describing patterns, solving problems, and modeling real-world situations.

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a symbol, usually a letter (like `x`, `y`, or `n`), that stands in for a number we don’t yet know or that can change.

**Examples:**

* `x = 3` means that the value of `x` is 3.
* In the expression `2x`, the `x` can be any value, and `2x` means "2 times whatever x is."

## What is an Expression?

An **expression** is a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations (like +, -, ×, ÷), but it does not include an equal sign.

**Examples:**

* `3x + 4`
* `2a - 5`
* `x² + 7x - 3`

These expressions don’t tell you the value directly — they represent formulas or rules that depend on what value you give the variable.

## Common Types of Expressions

### 1. **Monomial** – one term

```txt
5x
```

### 2. **Binomial** – two terms

```txt
x + 3
```

### 3. **Trinomial** – three terms

```txt
x² + 2x + 1
```

## Evaluating Expressions

To **evaluate** an expression means to substitute a value for the variable and simplify.

**Example:**
If `x = 2`, then:

```txt
Expression: 3x + 1
Substitute: 3(2) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7
```

## Translating Real-Life Scenarios into Expressions

Often, algebra helps describe real-world situations.

**Example:**
"A worker earns ₹15 per hour."

* Let `h` be the number of hours worked.
* Expression for total pay: `15h`

If the worker works 8 hours:

```txt
15h = 15 × 8 = ₹120
```
