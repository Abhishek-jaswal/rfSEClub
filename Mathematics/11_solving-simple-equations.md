# Solving Simple Equations

Equations are like balance scales. They show that two sides are equal. In math, we use equations to find unknown numbers (called variables).

## 1. What Is an Equation?

An **equation** is a math sentence that has an equal sign (=). It shows that two things are the same.

**Example:**

```txt
3 + x = 7
```

This means: 3 plus something equals 7. The goal is to find what number x must be.

## 2. Solving Equations by Using Inverse Operations

We solve equations by "undoing" what's happening to the variable.

**Example:**

```txt
x + 4 = 9
```

To solve, subtract 4 from both sides:

```txt
x + 4 - 4 = 9 - 4
x = 5
```

**Another Example:**

```txt
x - 3 = 10
```

Add 3 to both sides:

```txt
x = 13
```

**Multiplication Example:**

```txt
2x = 12
```

Divide both sides by 2:

```txt
x = 6
```

**Division Example:**

```txt
x / 5 = 4
```

Multiply both sides by 5:

```txt
x = 20
```

## 3. Equations

Think of equations like balancing a scale:

```txt
Left Side        =       Right Side
 3 + x           =            7
```

Take away 3 from both sides:

```txt
   x             =            4
```

The scale is balanced when both sides are equal.

## 4. Word Problems with Equations

**Example:**
"John has some pencils. If he buys 5 more, he will have 12 pencils. How many did he have before?"

Let x be the number of pencils he had:

```txt
x + 5 = 12
x = 12 - 5 = 7
```

John had 7 pencils.
