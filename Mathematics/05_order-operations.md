# Order of Operations

When solving math problems that contain more than one operation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponents), it's essential to follow a standard order. This ensures consistency and correctness in the solution.

## Why Does the Order Matter?

Consider this expression:

```txt
6 + 3 × 2 = ?
```

If you solve from left to right:

```txt
6 + 3 = 9
9 × 2 = 18 ❌ (Incorrect)
```

But if you apply multiplication first:

```txt
3 × 2 = 6
6 + 6 = 12 ✅ (Correct)
```

This difference highlights why we need to follow a strict sequence, called the **Order of Operations**.

## Understanding PEMDAS

The standard sequence is known by the acronym **PEMDAS**:

```txt
P – Parentheses
E – Exponents
MD – Multiplication and Division (left to right)
AS – Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
```

> Multiplication and Division are on the same level and should be handled from left to right, as they appear. The same applies to Addition and Subtraction.

## Example

Evaluate:

```txt
8 + (4 × 2)^2 ÷ 4
```

Step 1: Parentheses
→ (4 × 2) = 8

Step 2: Exponents
→ 8^2 = 64

Step 3: Division
→ 64 ÷ 4 = 16

Step 4: Addition
→ 8 + 16 = 24 ✅

## Another Example

Evaluate:

```txt
10 – 2 + 4 × 3
```

Step 1: Multiplication
→ 4 × 3 = 12

Step 2: Addition/Subtraction (left to right)
→ 10 – 2 = 8
→ 8 + 12 = 20 ✅
