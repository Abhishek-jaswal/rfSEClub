# Introduction to Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols to represent numbers and relationships. It allows us to describe patterns, express unknowns, and solve equations.

## What is Algebra?

Algebra lets us:

* Represent unknown values using letters (like `x`, `y`, `z`).
* Create expressions and equations to show how quantities are related.
* Solve problems by finding the values of unknowns.

### Example

If 3 pens cost ₹30 in total:

```txt
Let x = cost of one pen
Then 3x = 30
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 10
```

So, each pen costs ₹10.

## Key Concepts

### Variable

A symbol (usually a letter) used to represent an unknown value.

```txt
Example: x, y, z
```

### Constant

A fixed number that does not change.

```txt
Example: 3, 5, 10
```

### Expression

A mathematical phrase made up of variables, constants, and operations (like + or ×), but no equal sign.

```txt
Example: 2x + 5
```

### Equation

A statement that shows two expressions are equal.

```txt
Example: 2x + 5 = 15
```

### Solving an Equation

The process of finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

```txt
2x + 5 = 15
Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10
Divide by 2: x = 5
```
