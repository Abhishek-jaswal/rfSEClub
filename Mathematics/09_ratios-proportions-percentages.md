# Ratios, Proportions, and Percentages

Ratios, proportions, and percentages are used to compare values, scale numbers, and calculate parts of a whole. These concepts are used in daily life like sharing food, calculating discounts, and scaling recipes.

## Ratios

A **ratio** shows how much of one thing there is compared to another.

### Format

```txt
a : b
```

This means "a to b".

### Example

If there are 2 apples and 3 oranges:

```txt
Ratio = 2 : 3
```

This means for every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges. If we have 4 apples, we can expect 6 oranges to keep the same ratio.

Imagine:
🍎🍎🍊🍊🍊 → Grouped as 2 apples to 3 oranges.

If we double both:
🍎🍎🍎🍎🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊 → Still maintains a 2:3 ratio.

### Simplifying Ratios

```txt
6 : 9 = 2 : 3 (Divide both parts by 3)
```

Example: If there are 6 red marbles and 9 blue marbles, we can say the simplified ratio is 2:3 by dividing both numbers by their common factor (3).

## Proportions

A **proportion** shows that two ratios are equal.

### Format

```tt
a/b = c/d
```

This means “a is to b as c is to d.”

### Example

```txt
2/3 = 4/6 ✅
```

Both fractions simplify to the same value (0.666...), so this is a proportion.

Imagine you have 2 out of 3 parts painted red, and another object with 4 out of 6 parts also painted red. Both objects have the same proportion of red color.

### Solving Proportions

Use **cross multiplication**:

```txt
2/3 = x/6
2 × 6 = 3 × x
12 = 3x
x = 4
```

This tells us that if 2 pencils cost ₹X, then 4 pencils cost ₹4, keeping the price per pencil consistent.

## Percentages

A **percentage** is a number out of 100.

### Symbol

```txt
%
```

### Example

```txt
25% means 25 out of 100.
```

If you got 25 questions right out of 100 on a test, you scored 25%.

### Converting Between Forms

* Fraction to Percent: `3/4 = 75%` because `3 ÷ 4 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%`
* Decimal to Percent: `0.6 × 100 = 60%`
* Percent to Fraction: `40% = 40/100 = 2/5`

### Real-Life Examples

* **Shopping**: 20% discount on ₹500 → Save ₹100 → Final price = ₹500 - ₹100 = ₹400
* **Exams**: If you scored 45 out of 60 marks → `(45 ÷ 60) × 100 = 75%`
* **Statistics**: 30% of people voted for candidate A means 30 people out of every 100 chose candidate A.
