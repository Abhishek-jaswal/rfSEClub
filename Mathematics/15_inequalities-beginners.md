# Understanding Inequalities

Inequalities are like equations, but instead of an equal sign (`=`), they use symbols to show that one side is larger or smaller than the other. They help describe a range of possible values instead of a single solution.

## Inequality Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning                  | Example  |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `>`    | Greater than             | `x > 5`  |
| `<`    | Less than                | `x < 3`  |
| `≥`    | Greater than or equal to | `x ≥ 10` |
| `≤`    | Less than or equal to    | `x ≤ 2`  |

## Solving Inequalities

Solving inequalities is similar to solving equations. You aim to isolate the variable.

### Example 1

```txt
Solve: x + 4 > 7
Step 1: Subtract 4 from both sides
        x > 3
```

### Example 2

```txt
Solve: 2x ≤ 10
Step 1: Divide both sides by 2
        x ≤ 5
```

### IMPORTANT

When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a **negative number**, **flip the inequality sign**!

### Example 3

```txt
Solve: -3x < 9
Step 1: Divide both sides by -3 and flip the sign
        x > -3
```

## Real-Life Example

A cinema hall allows children **under 12 years** of age to get a discount.
Let `a` be the age:

```txt
a < 12
```

## Graphing Solutions (Number Line)

We often show inequality solutions on a number line:

* Open circle (`○`) means **not included** (e.g., `x > 3`)
* Closed circle (`●`) means **included** (e.g., `x ≥ 3`)
