## Probability and Statistics

Understanding probability and statistics is essential for making decisions under uncertainty and analyzing data.

### Coin Toss: Basic Probability

A **coin toss** is the simplest example of probability. It has two possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T).

**Probability values always range between 0 and 1.**

**Probability Formula:**

$$
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
$$

**Example:** What’s the probability of getting Heads?

* Total outcomes = 2 (H, T)
* Favorable = 1 (H)
* $P(H) = \frac{1}{2}$

✅ So, there's a 50% chance of landing Heads.

**Application:** Used in games, predictions, and understanding chance-based outcomes.

### Independent Events

Two events are **independent** if the result of one does not affect the result of the other.

**Example:** Rolling two dice.

* Probability of getting a 4 on die 1: $\frac{1}{6}$
* Probability of getting a 5 on die 2: $\frac{1}{6}$
* Combined: $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$

✅ The outcome of one die does not influence the other.

**Application:** Probability of multiple outcomes in games, sampling, or experiments.

### Distributions

A **distribution** shows how data is spread. One of the most common is the **normal distribution** (bell curve).

**Features:**

* Symmetrical shape
* Mean (center) = median = mode
* Most data clustered around the mean

**Example:** Test scores:

* Mean score = 70
* Most students score between 60 and 80

✅ That’s a normal distribution.

**Note:** The standard deviation tells us how spread out the values are. In a normal distribution:

* \~68% of values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean
* \~95% within 2 standard deviations

**Application:** Analyzing grades, heights, weights, etc.

### Average (Mean)

The **average** (or mean) is the sum of values divided by the number of values.

**Formula:**

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
$$

**Example:** Find the average of 10, 20, 30

* Sum = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60
* Count = 3
* $\text{Mean} = \frac{60}{3} = 20$

✅ So, the average is 20.

**Note:** The mean can be affected by extreme values (outliers). It's often useful to compare with the median and mode.

**Application:** Used in calculating class performance, batting averages, expenses, etc.

### Spread (Variance and Range)

**Spread** tells us how far values are from the average.

* **Range** = Largest – Smallest
* **Variance** = Average of squared differences from the mean
* **Standard Deviation** = Square root of variance

**Note:** Variance is expressed in squared units. Standard deviation brings it back to the original units and is easier to interpret.

**Example:** Data: 2, 4, 6, 8

* Mean = (2+4+6+8)/4 = 5
* Differences: -3, -1, +1, +3 → squares: 9, 1, 1, 9
* Variance = (9+1+1+9)/4 = 5
* Standard deviation = $\sqrt{5} \approx 2.24$

✅ Shows how values differ from the mean.

**Application:** Stock market analysis, weather forecasting, quality control.
