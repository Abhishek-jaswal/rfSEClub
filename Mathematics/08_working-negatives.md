## Understanding the Number Line

A number line helps us see where negative numbers are:

```txt
... -4  -3  -2  -1  0  1  2  3  4 ...
```

* Numbers to the left of 0 are negative.
* Numbers to the right of 0 are positive.

## Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers

### Adding a Negative Number

Adding a negative is the same as subtracting:

```txt
5 + (-3) = 5 - 3 = 2
```

### Subtracting a Negative Number

Subtracting a negative is the same as adding:

```txt
5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8
```

## Multiplying and Dividing Negative Numbers

### Multiplying

* Positive × Positive = Positive
* Negative × Positive = Negative
* Negative × Negative = Positive

Examples:

```txt
3 × 4 = 12
(-3) × 4 = -12
(-3) × (-4) = 12
```

### Dividing

* Same rules as multiplication.

Examples:

```txt
12 ÷ 3 = 4
-12 ÷ 3 = -4
-12 ÷ -3 = 4
```
