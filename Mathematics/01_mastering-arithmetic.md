# Mastering Arithmetic

Arithmetic is the basic building block of all higher-level math. It includes the four main operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Learning these operations well is important not just for math classes, but also for solving everyday problems in subjects like science, technology, business, and more.

## Addition

Addition is the process of putting numbers together to find a total, called the sum.

**Examples:**

* $5 + 3 = 8$
* $-4 + 7 = 3$

**Real-Life Uses:**

* Adding up bills while shopping
* Finding the total score in a game

---

## Subtraction

Subtraction is used to find out how much one number is less than another. It shows the difference between two values.

**Examples:**

* $10 - 7 = 3$
* $-3 - 5 = -8$

**Real-Life Uses:**

* Figuring out how much money you have left
* Finding out how many points one team lost by
* Measuring changes in temperature or data

---

## Multiplication

Multiplication is a quick way of adding the same number many times. It’s used a lot in math and science.

**Examples:**

* $6 \times 4 = 24$
* $-5 \times 3 = -15$

**Real-Life Uses:**

* Finding total cost: price × number of items
* Calculating area: length × width
* Physics formulas: $\text{Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$
* Figuring out earnings: price per item × number sold

---

## Division

Division is the opposite of multiplication. It shows how to split a number into equal parts.

**Examples:**

* $20 \div 4 = 5$
* $25.5 \div 5 = 5.1$

**Real-Life Uses:**

* Sharing things evenly between people
* Calculating cost per item

## Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)

When solving problems that have more than one operation, you need to follow a specific order:

1. Parentheses or brackets first
2. Exponents or powers
3. Multiplication and division (from left to right)
4. Addition and subtraction (from left to right)

**Examples:**

* $4 \times (2 + 3) = 4 \times 5 = 20$
* $8 \times 2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12$

Knowing this order helps you avoid mistakes when solving complicated expressions.
