# Linear Equations

A **linear equation** is an equation that represents a straight line when graphed. It is called "linear" because the variable(s) appear with no exponents higher than 1.

## General Form

The standard form of a linear equation in one variable is:

```txt
ax + b = 0
```

Where:

* `x` is the variable,
* `a` and `b` are constants, and
* `a ≠ 0`

Example:

```txt
2x + 5 = 0
```

## Solving Linear Equations

The goal is to isolate the variable on one side.

### Example 1

```txt
Solve: 2x + 4 = 10
Step 1: Subtract 4 from both sides
   2x = 6
Step 2: Divide by 2
   x = 3
```

### Example 2

```txt
Solve: 3x - 7 = 2
Step 1: Add 7 to both sides
   3x = 9
Step 2: Divide by 3
   x = 3
```

## Real-Life Example

If a train travels at 60 km/h, and we know the total distance is 180 km, how many hours will it take?
Let `t` be the number of hours:

```txt
60t = 180
Divide both sides by 60:
t = 3
```

So the train takes 3 hours.

## Important Properties

* Linear equations have **only one solution**.
* The graph is a **straight line**.
* Variables are to the **first power** (e.g., `x`, not `x²`).
