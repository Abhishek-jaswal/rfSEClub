# Functions Made Fun

A **function** is a special relationship where each input has exactly one output. Think of it like a machine: you put something in, the machine follows a rule, and you get something out.

Functions are important because they help us model and understand relationships in science, engineering, economics, and computer programming.

## What Is a Function?

In math, a function connects an **input** to exactly one **output** using a specific rule.

**Notation:**

```txt
f(x) = rule involving x
```

This means: “The function f takes x and gives back f(x)”

* `f` is the name of the function.
* `x` is the input.
* `f(x)` is the output, or result, after applying the rule to x.

### Example

```txt
f(x) = 2x + 3
If x = 1 → f(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5
If x = 4 → f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11
```

## Parts of a Function

* **Input (x)** – the value you start with
* **Function Rule** – the operation done to x
* **Output (f(x))** – the result after applying the rule

## Example

```txt
Input (x)
   ↓
[ Step 1: Multiply by 2 ]
   ↓
[ Step 2: Add 3 ]
   ↓
Output (f(x))
```

If x = 2:

```txt
2 → [×2 = 4] → [+3 = 7] → f(x) = 7
```

## Table of Values

You can create a table to understand how a function behaves:

| x | f(x) = 2x + 1 |
| - | ------------- |
| 0 | 1             |
| 1 | 3             |
| 2 | 5             |
| 3 | 7             |

## Real-Life Example

A taxi charges ₹50 as a base fare and ₹10 per kilometer.

Let `x` be the number of kilometers:

```txt
f(x) = 10x + 50
```

If you travel 5 km:

```txt
f(5) = 10(5) + 50 = ₹100
```

## Another example

A mobile data plan charges ₹200 per month plus ₹5 per GB used.
If you use 10 GB:

```txt
f(x) = 5x + 200
f(10) = 5(10) + 200 = ₹250
```

## Identifying Functions

To be a function, each input must give **only one output**.

### Not a Function

```txt
x = 2 gives y = 4 and y = 6 → Not a function
```

### How to Identify from Coordinates

If you have points like:

```txt
(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)
```

Each x has only one y → This is a function
But:

```txt
(1, 2), (1, 3)
```

The input 1 has two outputs → Not a function
