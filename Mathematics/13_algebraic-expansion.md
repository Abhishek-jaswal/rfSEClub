# Algebraic Expansion

Algebraic expansion involves multiplying expressions to remove parentheses and write the expression in a simpler, more usable form. This technique is commonly used in simplifying expressions and solving equations.

## What Does Expansion Mean?

When we expand an algebraic expression, we are applying the distributive property:

```txt
a(b + c) = ab + ac
```

This means that you multiply each term inside the parentheses by the term outside the parentheses.

## Examples of Expansion

### Example 1: Simple Binomial

```txt
Expand: 3(x + 4)
= 3 * x + 3 * 4
= 3x + 12
```

### Example 2: With Subtraction

```txt
Expand: 2(a - 5)
= 2 * a - 2 * 5
= 2a - 10
```

### Example 3: Double Binomials

To expand two binomials like:

```txt
(x + 2)(x + 3)
```

Use the FOIL method:

* First: x \* x = x²
* Outer: x \* 3 = 3x
* Inner: 2 \* x = 2x
* Last: 2 \* 3 = 6

```txt
= x² + 3x + 2x + 6
= x² + 5x + 6
```
